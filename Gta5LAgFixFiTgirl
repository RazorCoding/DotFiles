gta5 was working smothling until i found michel house. it slangs when going to his house how to fix .. im using nvidia and fitgrirl game
ChatGPT said:

When GTA 5 starts lagging or stuttering around Michael’s house, especially in a FitGirl repack version using NVIDIA GPU, it’s likely due to streaming or decompression issues rather than hardware power. Here’s how to fix or reduce the stutter:
✅ 1. Disable/Limit Extended Distance Scaling

This setting is often the culprit.

    Go to Settings → Graphics

    Find Extended Distance Scaling

    Set it to 0 or very low

🔧 This affects how far high-detail models are loaded — Michael's house area is packed with them.
✅ 2. Set NVIDIA Control Panel Settings

    Open NVIDIA Control Panel

    Go to Manage 3D settings

    Under Program Settings, add GTA5.exe

    Use these:

        Power Management Mode → Prefer maximum performance

        Threaded Optimization → On

        Triple Buffering → Off

        Low Latency Mode → On (or Ultra)

        Shader Cache → On

✅ 3. Run the Game as Administrator

    Right-click GTA5.exe → Properties → Compatibility

    Check Run as administrator

    Also check Disable fullscreen optimizations

✅ 4. Set Game Priority to High

    Launch the game, then press Ctrl + Shift + Esc for Task Manager

    Find GTA5.exe

    Right-click → Set priority → High

✅ 5. Check Pagefile Settings

Sometimes FitGirl repacks decompress during gameplay, hitting RAM/HDD limits.

    Make sure you have virtual memory (pagefile) enabled.

        Go to System Properties > Advanced > Performance Settings > Advanced > Virtual memory

        Enable System Managed Size or set at least 4096MB–8192MB

✅ 6. Defragment the Game Files (Only if on HDD)

If you installed on an HDD, use:

sudo e4defrag /path/to/game  # for ext4

Or use a GUI defragmenter if on Windows with NTFS.
✅ 7. Turn Off Background Apps

Apps like Discord overlays, MSI Afterburner, Razer Synapse, etc., may interfere. Disable them temporarily and try.
✅ 8. Optional: Install to SSD (if not already)

If installed on an HDD, moving GTA 5 to an SSD can drastically improve streaming issues like this.

If you've tried all of these and it still lags only at Michael's house, let me know:

    Your RAM size

    Whether you're using HDD or SSD

    Your NVIDIA driver version

    Any mods or reshades installed

I'll guide you more precisely from there. 👍

can't not find set prioty in task manger everytime i run i have do that? also how to do that im windows 11 Check Pagefile Settings
ChatGPT said:

Got it! Let's solve both of your issues step by step.
✅ 1. How to Set Priority for GTA5.exe in Task Manager (Windows 11)

You're right — you have to set priority every time you launch the game, unless you use a script or tool like Process Hacker. But here’s how to manually do it:
📌 Steps:

    Launch GTA 5 and minimize it (Alt + Tab)

    Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager

    Click "Details" tab (you may need to click “More details” first)

    Find GTA5.exe

    Right-click → Set priority → High

    ⚠️ You need to do this every time you run the game unless you automate it.

🔁 Automate Priority with a Batch File (Optional)

You can create a .bat file to run GTA5 with high priority:

@echo off
start "" /high "D:\Path\To\Your\GTA5.exe"

Just replace the path with your game path.
✅ 2. How to Check and Set Pagefile Settings on Windows 11

Sometimes the FitGirl repack decompresses during gameplay and hits RAM limits — pagefile helps avoid stutters.
📌 Steps:

    Press Win + S, type "View advanced system settings" and open it.

    In the System Properties window:

        Click "Settings…" under Performance

    In the Performance Options window:

        Go to the "Advanced" tab

        Under Virtual memory, click "Change…"

    Uncheck: “Automatically manage paging file size for all drives”

    Select your Windows drive (usually C:)

    Select System managed size (or set it manually — see below)

    Click Set → then OK

    Restart your computer.

Recommended Pagefile Size (Manual Option)

    Initial size: 4096 MB

    Maximum size: 8192 MB

This should reduce stutter caused by memory overflow.

Let me know your RAM size and storage type (SSD/HDD), I can tailor this even more. 👍

also i have prioty task mager real time then how the bat file i should create?
ChatGPT said:

Great question! If you want to set GTA5.exe to Real-time priority using a .bat file, here’s how to do it — but a warning first:
⚠️ Real-Time Priority Warning

Setting Real-time can make your system unstable or unresponsive, especially if GTA5 starts hogging the CPU. It's usually better to use High priority.

But if you're sure you want to try Real-time, here’s how:
✅ Batch File to Run GTA5 with Real-Time Priority
📄 Create a .bat file:

@echo off
start "" /realtime "D:\Path\To\Your\GTA5.exe"

📍 Replace:

D:\Path\To\Your\GTA5.exe

with the exact path to your GTA5.exe file.
🛠️ How to Save and Use:

    Open Notepad

    Paste the above code

    Click File > Save As

    Choose a name like GTA5_RealTime.bat

    Set Save as type to All Files (*.*)

    Save it on Desktop or your game folder

    Right-click → Run as Administrator

✅ Optional: Use High Priority Instead (More Stable)

@echo off
start "" /high "D:\Path\To\Your\GTA5.exe"

Let me know if you also want the game to start minimized, or with custom resolution or no intro video options — I can add that too. 👍

im only using windows for gta5?
ChatGPT said:

Got it — since you're only using Windows for GTA 5, here are some tips to optimize it just for gaming and ensure smooth performance:
✅ Essential Windows Optimizations for GTA 5 (Gaming Only)
🧹 1. Strip Down Background Services

Since it's a dedicated gaming OS:

    Disable startup apps:

        Ctrl + Shift + Esc → Startup tab → Disable everything not needed

    Run this in PowerShell (as admin) to remove Xbox bloat:

    Get-AppxPackage *xbox* | Remove-AppxPackage

⚙️ 2. Use a Gaming Power Plan

    Press Win + X → Power Options → Additional Power Settings

    Select High Performance or create a custom "Ultimate Performance" plan:

    powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61

    This will add the “Ultimate Performance” plan.

🖼️ 3. Disable Visual Effects

    Press Win + S → “Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows”

    Choose Adjust for best performance

🔒 4. Turn off Game DVR / Xbox Game Bar

Even though it's meant for gaming, it causes FPS drops in GTA 5.

    Settings → Gaming → Xbox Game Bar → Off

    Settings → Gaming → Captures → Off

🖱️ 5. Turn Off Mouse Acceleration

    Settings → Devices → Mouse → Additional Mouse Options

    Pointer Options tab → Uncheck "Enhance pointer precision"

📦 6. Keep NVIDIA Drivers Clean

If you're using FitGirl repack and gaming-only, you don’t need extra NVIDIA junk.

    Use NVCleanstall to install only the display driver and PhysX

🚀 7. Startup GTA 5 with Real-time or High Priority

Use your custom .bat file:

@echo off
start "" /realtime "D:\Games\GTA5\GTA5.exe"

📁 8. Keep GTA on SSD

If it’s not on an SSD, move it to one. The Michael's house stutter is often a loading/decompression delay from HDD.
💾 9. Use Pagefile if You Have Low RAM (<16GB)

Keep Virtual Memory (Pagefile) enabled as we discussed earlier.
🔥 Optional: Disable Windows Defender (Gaming-only system)

If you trust all files (offline-only), disabling Defender can reduce lag:

    Press Win + R, type gpedit.msc

    Navigate to:

    Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Microsoft Defender Antivirus

    Set Turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus to Enabled

Would you like a fully stripped, gaming-only Windows 11 Lite ISO suggestion for future reinstall, or want help turning this into a console-like setup for launching GTA directly on boot? 😎
You said:
where is gpedit.msc?
ChatGPT said:

On Windows 11 Home, gpedit.msc (Group Policy Editor) is not installed by default, unlike in Windows Pro or Enterprise editions.

But don’t worry — here’s how to install it manually on Windows 11 Home:
✅ Enable gpedit.msc on Windows 11 Home
🛠️ Step-by-Step:

    Open Notepad

    Paste this code:

@echo off
pushd "%~dp0"
dir /b %SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy-ClientExtensions-Package~3*.mum > gp.txt
dir /b %SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy-ClientTools-Package~3*.mum >> gp.txt
for /f %%i in ('findstr /i . gp.txt 2^>nul') do dism /online /norestart /add-package:"%SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\%%i"
pause

Save as:
InstallGpedit.bat
(choose All Files under Save As Type)

Right-click → Run as Administrator

Wait for it to finish, then press Win + R, type:

    gpedit.msc

    And hit Enter — it should open!

🧼 Alternate: Use Registry Instead (if you don’t want to install gpedit)

If you just want to disable Defender or other tweaks, I can give you registry files (.reg) that do the same job — no need for gpedit.

Let me know if you'd prefer that instead. 👍

i have it here C:\Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! Since your GTA 5 is located at:

C:\Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced

Here is your custom .bat file to launch GTA 5 in High Priority:
🎮 GTA5_HighPriority.bat

@echo off
cd /d "C:\Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced"
start "" /high "GTA5.exe"
exit

✅ How to Use:

    Open Notepad

    Paste the code above

    Go to File → Save As

        File name: GTA5_HighPriority.bat

        Save as type: All Files

    Save it on your Desktop (or wherever you want)

    Right-click → Run as Administrator when launching

💡 Bonus: Disable Intro Logo (optional)

If you want to skip the Rockstar intro video:

    Add this line inside your GTA V folder:

        Create a file named commandline.txt

    Add:

    -nologo

Let me know if you want that added directly from the BAT file too. 👍
You said:
okay done .. now let me reboot
ChatGPT said:

Awesome 👍 — go ahead and reboot. Once you're back, just run the .bat file as Administrator to launch GTA 5 with high priority.

If you run into lag near Michael’s house again, or want to auto-set pagefile or GPU settings, I can help with those too.

Enjoy your session — I'll be here when you're back! 🚗💥
